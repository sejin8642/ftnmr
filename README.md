# Fourier Transform and NMR

Fourier transform and its application in NMR is one of the tools that I use for my PhD dissertation. I will update this git repository with open-source codes that I use in my daily research. Any helpful tips and tools are welcome. 

## Getting Started

For now, there is no useful tools in this repository. I will update it soon.

### Prerequisites

Working PC (linux OS preferred) such as Ubuntu OS PC. For other platforms, please consult other sources.

### Installing

All of my computational research is done with Python. The only thing you need in order to run my code for your machine is Python. Python is mostlikely already installed in your linux OS. If not, run the following command:

```
sudo apt install python3
```

If you are on Fedora (or any closely-related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use dnf
```
sudo dnf install python3
```

## Anaconda 

I highly recommend that you install Anaconda and use it to manage all of your python packages and libraries in order to streamline your workflow. The link is [here][homepage].

### Python packages and libraries 

Many scientific python libraries are already installed with Anaconda. 

## Built With

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) - The web editor used to test the codes
